<p>We’ve had a lot of feedback from professors saying they have a difficult time determining when new posts or comments have been added to their discussion board topics. Additionally, instructors say there are too many clicks to see if their topics have any replies. This redesign centered around giving the user an “at a glance” view of their topics giving them an easier way to see updated content on discussion boards they follow.</p>

<p>The main improvement in this redesign was combining the boards and topics on one page giving users the ability to collapse and expand their boards to quickly find the content they need. </p>

<p>I also added labels that highlight when a topic has replies or unread comments.</p>

<p>I created a prototype for usability testing that also demos the expand/collapse functionality.
