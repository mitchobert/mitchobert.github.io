<p>The goal of this project was to make it easier and more intuitive for students to find and send their transcripts and access their old course materials.</p>

<p>After looking at the analytics and conducting some research interviews, I found that students were having difficulty finding their old course grades, emails, and transcripts because they didn’t know where to look. By combining the Archives and Course History pages, I made the process more streamlined.</p>

<p>To make it easier for students to find what they’re looking for, I added the ability to filter their previous courses and show and hide additional detail.</p>

<p>A project this massive has a lot of moving parts. In cases like this utilizing Illustrator’s artboards help me quickly design multiple views of a page depending on what action the user takes. I find it easier to create a streamlined experience when you have a more holistic view of what you’re designing.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the functionality and responsive design, I created a <a href="http://codepen.io/mitchobert/pen/ezBooy">quick prototype</a> for QA and the developers.</p>
