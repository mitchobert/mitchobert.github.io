<p>The purpose of this project was to create a more efficient experience for professors when they grade their discussion board posts. The discussion board is an essential part of the online education experience, regardless of the program.</p>

<p>Currently, professors are grading their discussion boards by using a dual monitor setup where they have the discussion board on one monitor and grade book open on another. I’ve designed a more streamlined way for professors to grade discussion boards and have outlined the significant improvements below.</p>

<h3>The New Design</h3>

<p>When creating a topic or editing an existing one, professors can now quickly make any assignment gradable and also associate it with any grade in the grade book.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
    <img class="img-responsive folio-detail" src="images/discussion-board-grading-ex1.png">
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
    <img class="img-responsive folio-detail" src="images/discussion-board-grading-ex2.png">
</div>
</div>

<p>I created an icon to indicate to professors which topic is a graded assignment.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
    <img class="img-responsive folio-detail" src="images/discussion-board-grading-ex3.png">
</div>
</div>

<p>When the professors start the grading process, they will have the ability to see how many posts a student has made, grade each post, and provide feedback directly all without having to leave the page. This new process will save them a lot of time having to keep up with scores on their own or using a second computer screen.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
    <img class="img-responsive folio-detail" src="images/discussion-board-grading-ex4.png">
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
    <img class="img-responsive folio-detail" src="images/discussion-board-grading-ex5.png">
</div>
</div>

<p>When the professor has finished grading the “submit scores” button sends all students grades and feedback to the grade book all at once.</p>

<p>The instructor’s grading progress will be saved if they leave the page and come back, so they no longer have to keep track on a separate notepad or worry about grading everything all at once giving the instructor more flexibility.</p>

<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">

<p>After the design process, I did some usability testing with several professors, and we received a lot of great feedback. All the participants seemed excited to use the new process.</p>
